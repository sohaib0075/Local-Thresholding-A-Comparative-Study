# Local-Thresholding-A-Comparative-Study

This project focuses on implementing adaptive thresholding algorithms—Niblack and Sauvola—from scratch in Python, without using any built-in thresholding functions. The goal is to convert a grayscale portrait image into a binary image by dynamically computing thresholds based on local image statistics. In Task 1, the Niblack method is implemented using a fixed constant k = -0.2, where the threshold for each pixel is calculated as the local mean plus k times the local standard deviation. Multiple window sizes (15, 31, 45, 61) are tested to study their effect on segmentation quality. In Task 2, the Sauvola algorithm is implemented as a variant of Niblack, using the formula T = m * (1 - k * (1 - s/R)) with k = 0.5 and R = 128, offering better performance in areas with varying contrast. Again, results for multiple window sizes are compared. A final integration section compares the best outputs from both methods using a common portrait image, analyzing the quality of edge preservation, noise suppression, and binarization clarity. This project showcases deep understanding of local thresholding techniques, efficient sliding window operations using NumPy, and their comparative visual performance on real portrait data.
